              <h2>Introducing Node</h2>
              <p>Date: 10<sup>th</sup> August 2021</p>
              <p>
                Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that 
                allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 
                The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a web server development perspective Node has a number of benefits:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).</li>
                <li>Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.
                </li>
              </ul>
