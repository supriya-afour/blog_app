                In our opinion creating some demo content by yourself is probably the easiest and cleanest solution.
                Usually you know best how many posts, categories, pages, etc. you will exactly need for your website 
                to make your layout work as expected. After you quickly have created some dummy content, 
                you can selectively delete or replace it later on with your own real content.

                Creating sample posts (Sample Post 1, 2, 3…), sample categories (Category A, B, C…) and sample 
                pages (Home, Archive, Contact…) can be done quickly and only takes a few minutes.
                If you need dummy text, you could copy and paste a few hundered words of Lorem Ipsum text
               into your articles.
